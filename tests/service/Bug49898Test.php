/**
 * Bug49898Test.php
 *
 * This test is for bug 49898.  Basically the plugin code is still dependent on the legacy versions of the SOAP api (soap.php).  As a result,
 * the search_by_module call is expecting a username and password combination.  However, the plugin code cannot supply a username and password, but
 * only has the session id information.  Therefore, as an alternative, it was proposed to have a workaround where if a username is empty, then the password
 * is assumed to be the session id.  This test replicates that check by searching on two modules (Accounts and Contacts) based on an email address
 * derived from the Contact.
