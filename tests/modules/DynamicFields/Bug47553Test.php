 *
 * This is a test that simulates the DynamicField saveToVardef call to ensure that the vardef definition for the Employees module
 * is correctly built when the Users vardef is rebuilt.  In particular we are interested to make sure that the status field has
 * a studio attribute set to false and that the status field is not required for the Employees vardef definition.
